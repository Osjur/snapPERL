# Sub in snapPERL.pl is called to build option hash on this config file. Makes it more readable 
# (1. Only use = when entering options for hash) (2. Every option should be followed with a comment)
# All white space, empty lines, lines without an = in and lines starting with # are ignored when parsed
# Nothing needs changing for script to run on normal snapraid install. Items marked with a * point to normal default location

## Sync options (Defaults will work fine for most people)
#  
# If the amount of deleted / changed files exceeds these limits you sync will stop. Set them to your needs.
# changedFiles added just in case you get ransomware that encrypts all your files. Stops the sync so you can recover. 
# I only ever expose one drive to read/write and others read only.
#
deletedFiles=50                                               # Max amount of deleted files to auto sync
changedFiles=500                                              # Max amount of changed files to auto sync

## Scrub options (Defaults will work fine for most people)
#
# Default setting will scrub new data after every sync. Then check age of oldest unscrubed block and if greater than scrubOldest.
# it will run a scrub using scrubAge for the youngest block to scrub and scrubPercentage to determine how much of array is scrubed.
# with useScrubNew=0 then scrub will be activated when newest unscrubed block gets older than scrubNewest.
# scrubEnforceMinDays sets a minimum about of days between scrubs. (does not deactivate useScubNew)
#
scrubEnable=1                                                 # If set to 0 will totaly disable scrub. Disable all scrub activity including useScrubNew
scrubNewest=7                                                 # Age of newest un-scrubed block before scub is run (useScrubNew will overide)
scrubOldest=30                                                # Max oldest block before scrub is run if using 'new' plan on sync (v9.0+ on)
scrubAge=10                                                   # Data older than days
scrubPercentage=8                                             # Percentage of array to scrub
useScrubNew=1                                                 # Scrub new data from sync and verify. (Supported in versions 9.0+ of snapraid).
scrubEnforceMinDays=0                                         # Overides all settings until time specifed in days elapses (Except useScrubNew - Turn off to scrub only at this interval)

## Smart options (Defaults will work fine for most people)
## You must have smartmontools installed on linux - ubuntu: sudo apt-get install smartmontools
## Snapraid is packaged with smartctl.exe for windows
#
# smartLog=1 calls snapraid smart and logs the output. The information the script sends to the log comes stright from snapraid.
# Warning levels will be checked and warning sent when exceeded. - Do not enable if you use NFS data drives.
#
smartLog=0                                                    # Check and log Smart data. 
smartWarn=70                                                  # Chance of fail percentage (whole array) to send warnings
smartDiskWarn=50                                              # Chance of fail percentage (disk) to send warnings
smartMaxDriveTemp=50                                          # Max temp before warnings issued
smartDiskErrorsWarn=1                                         # Number of errors to send warning regarding disk (Normal setting is 1)

## Check options (Defaults should work for most - Not enabled by default)
#
# Once a disk exceeds levels set a snapraid check will be run on it. See each option for more details.
# checkAuditOnly enabled means that only the disk will be checked not it's corresponding parity.
# Should be enougth to detect a failing disk. http://www.snapraid.it/manual
# New in v0.3
#
checkSuspectDisks=0                                           # Enable snapraid check on disks with Fail Percentage > checkDiskFailPercentage
checkAuditOnly=1                                              # Check suspect data disk only not the parity - Recomended setting otherwise very slow
checkOnlyAfterIncrease=1                                      # Only check once each time Fail Percentage increases over checkDiskFailPercentage (recomended setting)
checkDiskFailPercentage=90                                    # Fail Percentage to start checking
checkMinTimeBetweenChecks=7                                   # Minimum time that must pass between checks on suspect disks in days
checkAutoFix=0                                                # Auto call snapraid to fix recoverable files - NOT IMPLEMENTED!
 
## Snapraid options (Default locations entered)
#
# Main snapraid options.
# Script is configured to work with Linux installation by default. 
# snapRaidBin MUST contain the full path to the snapraid binary. 
# snapRaidConf MUST contain the full path to the snapraid conf file.
# Other options are very self explanatory.

# Snapraid Linux file locations (comment out these for Windows)

# Snapraid Windows file locations (uncomment these for Windows)
#snapRaidBin=C:\snapraid\snapraid.exe                         # Snapraid binary location - Windows - Must point to your snapraid.exe or script will abort
#snapRaidConf=C:\snapraid\snapraid.conf                       # Location of snapraid conf file - Windows - Must point to your snapraid.conf file or script will abort

preHashOnSync=1                                               # Pre-hash during sync to remove posiblity of silent error on busy machines. Please see snapraid manual http://www.snapraid.it/manual - Recomended Option! - v10.0+ only
resetTimeStamps=1                                             # Use touch command to reset sub-second time stamps (Snapraid 10.0+)
spinDown=0                                                    # Spindown array once script completed

## Other Options (Defaults will work fine for most. Disable logStdOut if using cron)
#
# If using snapraid below version 11.0 the script will carp about older unsupported versions.
# Set noVersionWarnings=1 and it will mind it's own business (Fully things could happen. Tested on v11.0)
#
logFile=snapPERL.log                                          # Main logfile name

## Email Options (Optional)
#
# Send mails. This is the overlord setting and will disable all if set to 0
# IMPORTANT: This script is not a SMTP deamon. It uses external services to send emails.

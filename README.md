# _*snapPERL v0.3.02*_

#Work in Progress to make it completely work with Snapraid 11+.

#####Automation script for Snapraid created in PERL

 Snapraid wrapper script written in **PERL**. Enables automation using cron for your Array Syncs

 Runs sync commands and verifys data using scrub command. Sends alerts when are issues found
 and aborts where needed. Plus much more see: _snapPERL.conf.example_

---

## Windows Compatible 
#### _Requires a PERL distribution to be installed_
##### Tested on Windows 10 - Snapraid x64 v11.5 and Latest ActivePerl 

## Linux Compatible (Not verified to work as of yet, though it should)
 
---

**This is just a wrapper for snapraid.exe**

It only ever calls snapraid (diff/status/sync/scrub/check/smart/down)

_(only Snapraid manipulates the data)_

####Script passes Perl::Critic - Severity: Stern

---

#### Important

__This script does not write to or manipulate any Array Data__

---

 
#####Script is expected to be run as root so it calls snapraid as root

#### _Please Read!_

* CHANGELOG
* INSTALL.md
* INSTALL-WINDOWS.md
* LICENSE
* _And the extensive comments for the options in: snapPERL.conf.example_
